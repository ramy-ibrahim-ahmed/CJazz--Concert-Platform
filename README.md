# cairo-jazz-club
My first Django project, I worked as the main backend developer, Cairo jazz club is a website that allows managing a party club very easily, and also allows customers to know the concert schedule and the artists with whom they have been contracted, as well as book tickets through the Paypal platform and learn about ticket plans.
